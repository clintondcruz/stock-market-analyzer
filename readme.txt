## Running the application
1. Go to the target folder, where the python files are saved
2. Open command prompt on that file directory
3. Install requirements (See INSTALL DEPENDENCIES section)

 Once the dependencies have been installed successfully,
 1. run 'python main.py' OR                              # Automatically installing dependencies
 2. run 'python -m streamlit run base.py' 


INSTALLING DEPENDENCIES--RUN EITHER OF THE TWO COMMANDS
'pip install -r requirements.txt'                    	 # Manually installing dependencies
'run 'python main.py'                                	 # Automatically installing dependencies


Both the approaches are designed taking into consideration the dependencies and packages which needs to be installed to run the application.
